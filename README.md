# test

1. we signed into github.com or created an account

2. we created a new repo

3. we cloned the new repo locally using github desktop

4. we edited the README.md file

5. we saved our work

6. we commit our files, then push our files to origin

7. we're going to check github.com to ensure our files were sychronized.
